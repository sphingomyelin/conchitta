Source Code for the Conchitta robot, STI Robotic Interdisciplinary Competition 2015 at the EPFL (http://robot-competition.epfl.ch/).

The robot uses a Raspberry Pi (rpi) for bottle detection, an Arduino Nano (micro) for proximity detection the LED beacons and an Arduino Mega 2560 (brain) as the main Final State Machine. The motors that run this mini-tank are controlled by the WildThumper TRex motor controller board.
